# PyMetaData
A commandline tool to read or write metadata into files, run setup.bat to download dependencies, run src\\main.py for the script!
### disclaimer!
this only works for PE(portable executables) and other things like .dll .cpl
also might cause your initial file to corrupt which is why the exe will go in src\\metadata-writer and not overwrite
